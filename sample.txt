C1: Drug Shortages: By implementing price controls, drug manufacturers will stop producing drugs, thus creating a drug shortage
Link: Medicare's price control system creates a "race to the bottom," prevents drug manufacturers from raising prices when necessary
Uniqueness: Already happened, status quo is already affected, these problems will only exacerbate if implemented nationwide
Internal Link: People who need drugs don't get them, or they use "grey market" or untested treatments (or no treatments)
Impact: 45,000 deaths annually due to drug shortages
Impact: "Grey market" - misplaced drugs from the grey market will cause an additional 50,000 deaths
Impact: Untested treatments - often costly and risky--more likely to die
Impact: No treatment (such as chemotherapy), estimated 40,000 additional deaths
